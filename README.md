# P.U.P.P.Y. Fail-On Power Switch

The P.U.P.P.Y. Switch (the Proven Unit for Perpetual Power, Y’know?) is the first commercially available fail-on switch designed for beetleweight combat robots! It’s battle-tested and built to keep your bot powered on through even the toughest matches. Designed by Kezia Skye, builder and driver of Chainsaw Kitty, this is the same switch that powered Kitty to victory at NHRL’s April 2025 event, where she claimed her Golden Dumpster. Each switch is assembled by hand and tested before shipping to ensure it’s ready for combat.

At 6.5g, it’s not the lightest switch available, but it trades weight for reliability and straightforward operation. Threaded M2 inserts in the case make mounting easy, and the 2.5mm hex drive screw offers easy power cycling. If you’re running a bot that needs to take hits and keep moving, this little pup’s ready to work.

!! Be sure to read the setup guide before setting up your puppy! It includes critical info about correct soldering, tab installation, and usage of the switch.

# What is a Fail-On Switch?

Other beetleweight power switches rely on tightening a screw to make contact and power the robot. But that connection has to stay tight through all the vibration and violent impacts of a match. If it loosens, your bot can shut down mid-fight!

The P.U.P.P.Y. Switch takes the opposite approach. It’s a fail-on switch, meaning the default state is powered on, and the screw only comes into play when powering down. A strong internal spring keeps the switch closed and your bot powered through even the roughest hits. Once your pup is awake, it’s staying that way until you say otherwise!
